            Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate developer with experience
            in building web applications and solving complex problems. I have
            over 14 years of learning and now it is time to put that learning to
            work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am proficient in a variety of programming languages and
            frameworks, including JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Python. I
            enjoy creating user-friendly interfaces and efficient backend
            systems. My goal is to continuously improve my skills and contribute
            to innovative projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I am not coding, I enjoy spending time with family and friends.
            I also like to read books of many genres, and I am a frequent
            visitor to the library. I believe in lifelong learning and am always
            eager to explore new technologies and stay updated with industry
            trends. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to
            connecting with you!
